Features:
------------------------------------------------

- Create a method for extracting a card's flavor text. Add :flavor_text to the MtgCard model.
Update test.

Bugs / Refactorings:
------------------------------------------------

- A new piece of card data, "Watermark", is currently being merged into a card's
oracle text (for those that have a watermark) rather than as an individual attribute.
(Example: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253532).

We can either ignore that or extract Watermark out into a separate attribute.

Misc:
------------------------------------------------

- We want this gem to work with Rails 3.0 and up. We still need to test it out on these
versions:

  - 3.1
  - 3.0

- Write some good documentation on using this gem and provide a sample Rails app
showing how it can be set up.
