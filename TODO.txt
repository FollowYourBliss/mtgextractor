Features:
------------------------------------------------

- Create a method for extracting a card's flavor text. Add :flavor_text to the MtgCard model.
Update test.

- Pull down all set symbols and add :symbol to MtgSet (generators too)



Bugs / Refactorings:
------------------------------------------------

- Update processing of card images to check for the use of the Asset Pipeline
and adjust where the images are stored based on the Rails app's config.

- A new piece of card data, "Watermark", is currently being merged into a card's
oracle text (for those that have a watermark) rather than as an individual attribute.
(Example: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253532).

We can either ignore that or extract Watermark out into a separate attribute.
