Features:
------------------------------------------------

 - Possibly make MTGExtractor into a Ruby gem. I'm thinking this could end up being
 more than just a collection of Ruby scripts used to scrape Gatherer. Perhaps it could
 provide "scaffolding" for creating MTG Rails applications. For example, we could ship 
 several classes for interacting with cards and card data through ActiveRecord.

  Example models:

    Card, Set, CardType, etc... 

 Ultimately, I'd want to source this gem in my Rails app's Gemfile, run a rake task to
 set up the gem for the first time, and then be able to run a rake task to process 
 all the sets (or individual ones) whenever I want. 

  Example tasks:  
  
    rake mtgextractor:setup             # Create tables used to store MTG card data
    rake mtgextractor:update_all_sets   # Extracts every card in every set from Gatherer and saves it to the DB
    rake mtgextractor:update_set <name> # Extracts every card in given set from Gatherer and saves it to the DB
            

Bugs / Refactorings:
------------------------------------------------

- Fix extraction of converted mana cost. It appears to return a 0 for the front side
of a double-faced card.
- Fix extraction of oracle texts
- Improve CardExtractor#determine_colors to handle unusual mana costs such as Ashenmoor Liege and Moltensteel Dragon have.
