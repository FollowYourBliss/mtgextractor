- Create a method for extracting a card's printed text.

- Consider the relationship between a card and set. A set has many cards. A card
can belong to one or many sets. Do we want to have functionality that allows us 
to ask for every set the card shows up in, or do we want to treat them as different
cards that belong to only one set because they have different multiverse ids?
