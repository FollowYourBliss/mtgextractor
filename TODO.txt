- Create a method for extracting a card's printed text.

- Consider the relationship between a card and set. A set has many cards. A card
can belong to one or many sets. Do we want to have functionality that allows us 
to ask for every set the card shows up in, or do we want to treat them as different
cards that belong to only one set because they have different multiverse ids?

- The current method for obtaining all cards for a set does not work for dealing
with multipart cards because they contain the same multiverse ids. We either need
to rewrite how we're extracting set/card data, or find some way to process the
other set by following the other part's link.
