Features:
------------------------------------------------

- Create a method for extracting a card's flavor text. Add :flavor_text to the MtgCard model.
Update test.

- Brainstorm possible solutions for retrieving card images. Here's a couple:

    - Downlod them during set processing (rake task) and store them locally. This
    will of course require us to see if the Rails app is using the asset pipeline
    or not.

    - Hotlink the images directly from Gatherer. This could get scary later on,
    however. 


Bugs / Refactorings:
------------------------------------------------

- We're currently relying on RestClient to handle our requests. While this will
work fine for MRI, I don't think it works on JRuby. We might need to find another library
to rely on that works for both.

Alternatively, we could simply find one that works similarly to RestClient for JRuby,
then create our own wrapper class that will use the appropriate version based
on what version of Ruby is running this code. Example:

class CustomClient
  def self.get(url)
    RestClient.get(url) if Ruby
    SomeClient.get(url) if JRuby
  end
end

Then just replace all calls to RestClient in our extractors with CustomClient.
