Features:
------------------------------------------------

- Create a method for extracting a card's printed text. Add :printed_text to
the MtgCard model. Update tests.

- Create a method for extracting a card's author. Add :author to the MtgCard model.
Update test.

- Create a method for extracting a card's flavor text. Add :flavor_text to the MtgCard model.
Update test.

- Brainstorm possible solutions for retrieving a card images. Here's a couple:

    - Downlod them during set processing (rake task) and store them locally. This
    will of course require us to see if the Rails app is using the asset pipeline
    or not.

    - Hotlink the images directly from Gatherer. This could get scary later on,
    however.
