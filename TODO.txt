Misc:
------------------------------------------------

- We want this gem to work with Rails 3.0 and up. We still need to test it out on these
versions:

  - 3.1
  - 3.0

- Write some good documentation on using this gem and provide a sample Rails app
showing how it can be set up.

- Figure out an actual gem versioning scheme that works.
